**ðŸŽ¶ "Two Million Dollar Blues" ðŸŽ¶**  

*(Verse 1)*  
Started with a wet dream, two million in my hand,  
Thought Iâ€™d conquer the world, had a master plan.  
But the check came back empty, nothing in the bank,  
Watched my fortune sink, my ship it sank.  

*(Chorus)*  
Two million-dollar blues, whatâ€™s a man to do?  
From riches to rags, my dreams fell through.  
Lost my shot, paid my dues,  
Now Iâ€™m singing these two-million-dollar blues.  

*(Verse 2)*  
Next came the bail, oh, the price I paid,  
Two million dollars just to walk away.  
But the bills piled high, the doctorâ€™s fee,  
Two million more just to keep breathing free.  

*(Chorus)*  
Two million-dollar blues, whatâ€™s a man to do?  
From riches to rags, my dreams fell through.  
Lost my shot, paid my dues,  
Now Iâ€™m singing these two-million-dollar blues.  

*(Bridge)*  
Hell Bank Notes in the underworld I toss,  
Trying to fix the mess, but Iâ€™m still at a loss.  
Opportunity knocked, but I slammed the door,  
Now Iâ€™m stuck in this cycle, forever poor.  

*(Chorus)*  
Two million-dollar blues, whatâ€™s a man to do?  
From riches to rags, my dreams fell through.  
Lost my shot, paid my dues,  
Now Iâ€™m singing these two-million-dollar blues.  

*(Outro)*  
So here I am, with my story to tell,  
Two million dollars couldnâ€™t keep me from hell.  
Iâ€™ll sing this song till my troubles fade,  
Two million blues in the life I made.
